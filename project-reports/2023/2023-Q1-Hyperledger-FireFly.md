# Project Health

FireFly V1.2 was released this quarter with an announcement with greater detail [here](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/02/13/hyperledger-firefly-v1-2-is-now-available). Highlights include token API enhancements, experience enhancements, and updated blockchain connector settings.

The Discord community continues to be very active with 74 members participating in discussions this quarter. Additionally, we’ve seen an increase in non-maintainer engagement, with community members conversing and answering each other’s questions.

Contributors are very active in the project and since December, excluding merges, we’ve had 22 authors push 378 commits to main.

There are currently 640k lines of code for Hyperledger FireFly across 19 repositories, with a total of 7k commits to date.
